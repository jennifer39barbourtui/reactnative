**If you have troubles with THREE.js or another 3D framework (importing a 3D model, displaying a texture, etc...) please submit your bug elsewhere (in a THREE.js support forum for example).**

**If you have trouble with React, Vue, Angular... please also file your bug elsewhere. If we release a framework agnostic library it is not to talk about these specific frameworks.**

**If you need support with THREE.JS or integration into a specific frontend framework, we would be happy to help you :) ( we charge for this ). You can contact us on [Jeeliz official website](https://jeeliz.com)**

If your bug is about FaceFilter, compatibility error, camera access, thank you very much for helping us to make our library better. Please provide:

* A clear and concise description of what the bug is: what you expect and what happens,
* How to reproduce it,
* Some screenshots if applicable,
* Detailed information about your configuration, especially if you are facing a compatibility error with a specific device. Please read [this section of the README](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter#compatibility).
