This is NOT a help site. Do not ask help questions here.

* If you have troubles with THREE.js or another 3D framework (importing a 3D model, displaying a texture, etc...) please submit your bug on [THREE.js issue section](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues) or [THREE.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/) or [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js).

* If you have trouble with React, Vue, Angular... please also file your bug elsewhere. If we release a framework agnostic library it is not to talk about these specific frameworks.

If you need support with THREE.JS or integration into a specific frontend framework, we would be happy to help you :) ( we charge for this ). You can contact us on [Jeeliz official website](https://jeeliz.com)**

If your bug is about FaceFilter, compatibility error, camera access, thank you very much for helping us to improve this library. Please provide:

* Some screenshots if applicable,
* Detailed information about your configuration, especially if you are facing a compatibility error with a specific device. Please read [this section of the README](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter#compatibility).
